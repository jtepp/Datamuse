# Datamuse
> A tool to make the Datamuse API more accessible

If you've ever had an English class, you should know about [Datamuse](datamuse.com)

Sites like [RhymeZone](rhymezone.com), [WikiSearch](wikisearch.com), [OneLook](onelook.com), and more all use the [Datamuse API](api.datamuse.com)

Looking through the [documentation](https://www.datamuse.com/api/) you can see that the API provides an insane amount of functionality, yet no site exists with all those features available in one spot.

That is until now, with my [Datamuse toolkit](https://datamuse.cf)
